# Me In Markdown
##Introduction:

Hello! My name is Ayaan and I am a sophomore at Chatsworth Charter High School. My favorite book is The Maze Runner - Fever Code or one of the Harry Potter books. My favorite movie is Ford v Ferrari, which I saw when I was nine years old. That movie forever changed my life and I highly recommend that you watch it! Over the past year, I have played a lot of tennis after not playing for a few years. With consistent practice, I made the tennis team and I love playing tennis with my friends in 6th period. For this school year, I am taking 4 AP classes and my goal is to get 4’s and 5’s on all my exams even though it will be challenging. 

Over summer, I went to New York City and had a great time. My family managed to get reservations at a Michelin star Indian restaurant and we enjoyed it a lot. Along with this, we walked around the city and I even got to walk around the NYU campus. In this class, I hope to get much better at coding, especially Java. Websites such as github are very unfamiliar to me and I really enjoy coding so I would hope to learn about a lot of tools that are able to be used in the coding world. I feel that this class will be very enjoyable and that I will learn a lot. Outside of school, I engage in playing videogames (Mariokart, Zelda, and Minecraft being my favorites) and also Karate. I am currently 2 black belt tests away (2-3 months) from receiving my black belt and I am very excited for that to happen.

 I love music and some of my favorite music artists are Playboi Carti, Eminem, and Kendrick Lamar who I have seen in concert. I also attended Rolling Loud back in march which was extremely fun. When I graduate, I hope to go to a good university and study something technology related. I have always had a passion for technology (I built my own gaming pc and gaming keyboard) and I hope to one day go into a field that I enjoy and that I am good at.


Below is the link to a playlist of a lot of my favorite songs that I have loved over the past few years. Every song in there has a backstory on how it relates to me!
